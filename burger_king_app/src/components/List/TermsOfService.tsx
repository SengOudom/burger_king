          For purposes of this Section 13 (Dispute Resolution, Arbitration, and
          Class Action Waiver), the term “RBI” or “we” shall include RBI and its
          subsidiaries, affiliates, and their respective shareholders,
          directors, officers, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
          successors, and assigns. Except where prohibited by applicable law,
          which may include the Province of Quebec (to the extent applicable),
          the following terms apply to all legal disputes between you and RBI.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          You and RBI agree to arbitrate all “Disputes” between us. “Dispute”
          means any dispute, claim, or controversy (excluding those exceptions
          listed below), whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
          misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, that either of us seeks
          legal recourse for, including the validity, enforceability,
          applicability, scope, or meaning of this agreement to arbitrate or any
          portion of it, and including claims that arose before this or any
          prior agreement or that arise after the termination of the Terms. The
          term Dispute will be given the broadest possible meaning permitted by
          law. In Disputes involving minors, where the minors’ parent(s) or
          guardian(s) have accepted these Terms of Service, claims asserted by
          the minor(s) and by the minors’ or minors’ parent(s) or guardian(s)
          are subject to this agreement to arbitrate.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          Only the following Disputes are exempt from the arbitration
          requirement: (1) complaints you wish to make to a government agency;
          (2) small claims court actions (as discussed below); (3) claims
          related to intellectual property infringement; (4) claims related to
          the enforceability of the requirement that arbitrations must be
          conducted on an individual basis only; (5) disagreements over the
          satisfaction of the Informal Resolution requirement described below as
          a prerequisite to arbitrating; and (6) actions to compel arbitration
          or to uphold or enforce any prior arbitration decision. Further, you
          or RBI may seek an injunction in court on an individual (non-class)
          basis to preserve the status quo between us for the entire period
          until we resolve the Dispute in arbitration.

          A. Informal Resolution
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          If you have a Dispute against us, or if we have a Dispute against you,
          you and we will make a good-faith effort to negotiate the resolution
          of any Dispute for at least 30 days (“Informal Resolution”) from the
          day you or we receive a written notice of a dispute from the other
          party (a “Notice of Dispute”) in accordance with these Terms.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          You must send any Notice of Dispute—and any other correspondence
          required by this agreement—to the following address for RBI:
          Restaurant Brands International US Services LLC, Attn: Legal, 5707
          Blue Lagoon Drive, Miami, Florida 33126.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          We will send any Notice of Dispute to the email address and/or any
          physical address you have provided us.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          The Notice of Dispute sent by either party must include the sender’s
          name, address, and other contact information, a description of the
          Dispute (including any relevant account names), and what resolution to
          the Dispute is being sought.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          The Notice requirement is designed to allow us (or you, in the case of
          a dispute we assert against you) to make a fair, fact-based offer of
          settlement if we or you choose to do so. You and we cannot proceed to
          arbitration unless this information has been provided. If you or we
          proceed to arbitration without providing a compliant Notice of
          Dispute, the sufficiency of a Notice of Dispute is an issue to be
          decided by a court. A court may enjoin the filing of an arbitration
          demand that has not been preceded by a compliant Notice of Dispute and
          may order a party that has filed an arbitration demand without having
          provided a compliant Notice to reimburse the other party for any
          arbitration fees and costs already incurred.

          either the county where you live or the United States may be brought
          as individual actions only in such small-claims courts. TO THE FULLEST
          EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND RBI AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT
          TO A JURY TRIAL IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. Any Dispute brought in small
          claims court must remain in such court and may not be removed or
          appealed to a court of general jurisdiction and may advance only on an
          individual (non-class, non-representative basis).

          C. Binding Individual Arbitration
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          You and we agree that Disputes notresolved through Informal Resolution
          will be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by
          National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), https://namadr.com,
          according to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and federal
          arbitration law and according to NAM’s Comprehensive Dispute
          Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the Dispute
          arises (the “NAM Rules”), as modified bythese Terms, unless you reside
          in a country where NAM is not available to arbitrate the Dispute, in
          which case the arbitration will be conducted by the American
          Arbitration Association (“AAA”), https://www.adr.org. For disputes
          that must be arbitrated by AAA, the then-current version of the AAA’s
          Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply. This agreement to arbitrate
          affects interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this agreement
          will be substantively and procedurally governed by the FAA, 9 U.S.C. §
          1, et seq., to the extent permitted by law.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS IN THIS SECTION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN
          INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY. Under no circumstances do we consent to have
          any Disputes arbitrated using class action procedures, even if the
          arbitration provider has rules permitting class arbitrations.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          “Arbitration” means that Disputes between us will be resolved by a
          neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          “Individual” means that the arbitrator may award the same remedies to
          you or to us as a court could, but only to satisfy your or our
          individual claims. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law,
          the arbitrator may not award money or other relief for the benefit of
          any person other than you or us as part of the resolution of any
          Dispute.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          “Binding” means that both you and we will have to live with the
          arbitrator’s decision, except to the limited extent appeals to a court
          are permitted under the FAA. As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and
          the rules applicable to the arbitration, the arbitrator will have
          exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions
          regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be
          available in court, including the power to determine the question of
          arbitrability. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary,
          interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for
          specific performance of these Terms, but (as provided above) only to
          the extent necessary to provide relief to a party in arbitration
          warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award
          rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court
          having jurisdiction.

        <div className="py-3">1. Arbitration Procedure and Location</div>
        <div className="py-3">
          You or we may initiate arbitration of any Disputes not resolved by
          Informal Resolution by filing a Demand for Arbitration with NAM in
          accordance with the NAM Rules (or with AAA in accordance with the AAA
          Rules if you reside in a location where NAM is not available to
          arbitrate the dispute). Instructions for filing a Demand for
          Arbitration with NAM are available on the NAM website or by calling
          NAM at 800-358-2550. Instructions for filing a Demand for Arbitration
          with AAA are available on the AAA website or by calling AAA at
          800-778-7879. You will send a copy of any Demand for Arbitration to
          RBI at the address specified above. We will send any Demand for
          Arbitration to the email address and to any physical address you have
          provided us.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. You and we
          both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English
          language and that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          For Disputes in which the claimant seeks less than $10,000, the
          arbitrator will decide the matter solely on the basis of written
          submissions, without a formal hearing, unless the arbitrator decides
          that a formal hearing is necessary. For matters in which the claimant
          seeks $10,000 or more, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator
          determines a hearing to be necessary, hearings shall be conducted by
          video or telephone, unless the arbitrator determines an in-person
          hearing to be necessary. If an in-person hearing is required, and you
          reside in the United States, the hearing will take place in Miami-Dade
          County, Florida, unless the arbitrator determines that this would pose
          a hardship for the claimant, in which case the in-person hearing may
          be conducted in the claimant’s state and county of residence. If you
          reside outside the United States, the site of any in-person hearing
          will be determined by the applicable Rules.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute. Unless
          you and we agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a
          written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for
          the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal
          findings and conclusions.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the arbitrator may
          only award legal or equitable remedies that are Individual to you or
          us to satisfy one of our Individual claims (that the arbitrator
          determines are supported by credible relevant evidence).
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          An arbitration award, and any judgment confirming it, apply only to
          that specific case; it cannot be used or offered as precedent in any
          other case except to enforce the award itself.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court
          of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made
          to such court for judicial confirmation of any award and an order of
          enforcement.

        <div className="py-3">2. Notice and Filing</div>
        <div className="py-3">
          To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you or we must
          start arbitration of a Dispute within two (2) years from when the
          Dispute first arose. If applicable law requires you or us to bring a
          claim for a Dispute sooner than two years after the Dispute first
          arose, that shorter deadline applies instead. The failure to begin
          arbitration regarding a Dispute within the time frames described above
          in this section shall bar the Dispute, which means that to the fullest
          extent permitted by applicable law, you and we will not have the right
          to assert the Dispute.

        <div className="py-3">3. Consumer Arbitration Fees</div>
        <div className="py-3">
          The terms of this section only apply to you if you are a Consumer, and
          only to disputes that are not Coordinated Cases.

        <div className="py-3">
          If you start an arbitration against us, you will pay the filing fee
          required for consumer arbitrations. In some situations, we will help
          you with the fees related to an arbitration you initiate against us to
          (hopefully) get us to a resolution quickly and fairly: • If the
          Dispute involves a claim of damages of USD $5,000 or less, including
          any attorneys’ fees and all other relief you are seeking, we will pay
          all of the arbitration costs, including the fees you otherwise would
          have been required to pay.• Even if the Dispute involves a claim of
          damages of more than USD $5,000, we may still help you with your fees:
          if you demonstrate that arbitration costs will be prohibitive compared
          to litigation costs, we will pay as much of your arbitration costs as
          the arbitrator finds is necessary to prevent arbitration from being
          cost-prohibitive (as compared to the cost of litigation)• For purposes
          of calculating damages under this paragraph and determining our
          obligation to pay the claimants’ share of fees, the amounts sought in
          claims brought by multiple claimants represented by the same or
          coordinated counsel will be aggregated.
