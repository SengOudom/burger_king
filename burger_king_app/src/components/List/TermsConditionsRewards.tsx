        By participating in the Program, you can earn points (“Crowns”) every
        time you visit a participating Burger King® restaurant in the Territory
        and complete an Eligible Transaction (defined below). Crowns may be
        redeemed at participating Burger King® restaurants in the Territory for
        select eligible items (the “Eligible Menu Items”), subject to compliance
        with these Program Terms (“Rewards”). From time to time, other bonus
        features and offers may also be made available to you, allowing you to
        receive other Burger King® or third-party benefits (the “Bonus
        Feature(s)”), earn and redeem Crowns in additional ways, or otherwise
        participate in the Program, all as determined by the Sponsor in its sole

      <div className="py-3">(i) Earning Crowns</div>
      <div className="py-3">
        As a Member, you will earn ten (10) Crowns for every $1.00 USD spent
        (after discounts, excluding applicable taxes and fees) on eligible
        transactions made at a participating Burger King® restaurant in the
        Territory using one of the following methods: (1) on the App or Website
        for dine-in, pick up or delivery, excluding third-party food delivery
        aggregator orders; or (2) on in-restaurant orders by using one of the
        following (i) the 6-digit “My Code” (where available) located in your
        Account, or (ii) using a credit card linked to your Account (“Linked
        Card”) at participating Burger King® restaurants in the Territory, (each
        an “Eligible Transaction”). All Crown earning methods may not be
        available in all the Territory.
      </div>
      <div className="py-3">
        An Eligible Transaction for Alaska and Hawaii Members means a
        transaction made only (1) on the App or Website for dine-in or pick up,
        excluding delivery orders; or (2) in-restaurant by using the 6-digit “My
        Code” (where available) located in your Account.
      </div>
      <div className="py-3">
        You can earn Crowns on up to three (3) Eligible Transactions per Account
        per day. Your first three (3) Eligible Transactions, regardless of
        method, will accrue Crowns to your Account.
      </div>
      <div className="py-3">
        If your Eligible Transaction involves the use of a digital coupon, where
        available in the Territory, you will earn Crowns based on actual amount
        paid. For the avoidance of doubt, you will not get Crowns for the
        discounted amount of your transaction. Print coupons cannot be used in
        connection with the Program. If your amount paid includes a decimal, the
        Crowns earned will be rounded down to the nearest tenth. You will not
        earn additional Crowns when using Crowns to redeem any reward(s) you
        earn. If you make a purchase in addition to the use of Crowns during one
        single transaction, you will earn Crowns on the actual amount paid. An
        Eligible Transaction paid with your BK Crown gift card will result in
        Crowns. A transaction made to purchase or reload a BK Crown gift card is
        not an Eligible Transaction.
      </div>
      <div className="py-3">
        Crowns earned in connection with an Eligible Transaction will be
        automatically applied to your Account within 48 hours of completing the
        Eligible Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, a transaction
        completed via a third-party ordering website, a delivery aggregator or
        other unauthorized means is not an Eligible Transaction. A transaction
        that does not result in a completed transaction equal or greater than
        $1.00 USD (after discounts, excluding applicable taxes and fees) is not
        an Eligible Transaction.
      </div>
      <div className="py-3">
        If you forget to use either the 6-digit “My Code” located in your
        Account or your Linked Card during your in-restaurant purchase, please
        visit bk.com/claim-points to claim your Crowns within 48 hours of
        purchase. Account registration required. Claiming Crowns via
        in-restaurant receipt is only available at participating U.S. Burger
        King® restaurants. Limit one (1) receipt per day is eligible for Crowns.
        A valid receipt is required to claim your Crowns. Lost, stolen, or
        misplaced receipts cannot be replaced.

      <div className="py-3">(ii) Rewards</div>
      <div className="py-3">
        Members that comply with the Terms may redeem Crowns for Eligible Menu
        Items (as listed below) in accordance with the redemption requirements
        set out below.
      </div>
      <div className="py-3">
        Rewards can be redeemed at a participating Burger King® restaurant in
        the Territory on Mobile Orders or In-Restaurant Orders. To redeem a
        reward, visit “My Code” on the App or Website and click “Add Reward and
        Offer.” To redeem a reward on an In-Restaurant Order, please click
        “Redeem in Restaurant” and show the 6-digit "My Code" on your Account at
        time of purchase. For In-Restaurant Orders, the 6-digit "My Code" has a
        limit of one (1) digital coupon/offer (where available in the Territory)
        per transaction. Limit one (1) 6-digit "My Code" use per order. Digital
        coupons/offers, where available in the Territory, are limited to one
        every 60 minutes. The use of digital coupons/offers may not be available
        in all the Territory.
      </div>
      <div className="py-3">
        Each Eligible Menu Item excludes the cost of modifications, for example
        extra bacon or add cheese. If Crowns are redeemed for an Eligible Menu
        Item that includes a modifier, the price of the modifier will be charged
        separately. Rewards can be combined with one (1) digital offer/coupon
        where available in the Territory. Print coupons cannot be used in
        connection with the Program. Eligible Menu Items are subject to
        availability at participating Burger King® restaurants in the Territory.
