          Mobile Ordering and Mobile Payment may not be available for all Burger
          King® restaurant locations. Some restaurants may not sell all menu
          items, and certain menu items may be subject to limited availability,
          or availability that is limited to certain times of the day. Images of
          menu items on the Mobile Services may not be identical to what you
          receive.
        </div>
        <div className="py-3">
          When you use the Mobile Services for Mobile Ordering, you must select
          the participating Burger King® restaurant, and the approximate time of
          pick-up or delivery. Please select your location and pick-up/delivery
          time carefully, as once you have confirmed your order, it cannot be
          canceled. You must also select whether you are placing an order for
          pick-up or delivery. To use the Mobile Services, you will need to
          enter your address, name, and phone number, and RBI will share the
          information you enter with the restaurant or the delivery provider (as
          applicable) assigned to your order, and such information will be
          subject to our{" "}

          and/or the third party delivery partner’s privacy policy, if
          applicable. Not all Burger King® restaurant locations offer both
          pick-up and delivery, and the availability of in-restaurant dining may
          vary. Delivery is not available in all locations and, if delivery is
          available, it may be available only to a limited geographic area and
          only for a limited time. Prices may be higher than in restaurant for
          delivery. Delivery fees, service fees, surge fees, small order fees,
          supplemental fees and charges, driver benefit fees, and other fees and
          charges associated with orders placed for delivery may apply and vary
          by location and are subject to change at any time. Delivery in the BK®
          app is governed by the{" "}

          If your order is not picked up at the selected time, or if we attempt

          Deliveries will only be made to a valid address (as determined by RBI

          reserve the right in our sole and absolute discretion to cancel your
          order. In the event we are not able to deliver to the address you
          provide, we will notify you, your order will be cancelled, and you
          will receive a refund. You acknowledge and agree that delivery times
          may vary, and RBI makes no warranty or guarantee with respect to when
          your order will be delivered. Time estimates for deliveries are
          provided for convenience only and are subject to change. RBI is not
          responsible for inaccurate delivery time estimates.

          through the Mobile Services using the payment option we make available
          through the Mobile Services at the time of ordering. You also have a
          legal obligation to pay for any orders you place in restaurant or at a
          drive-through when using Mobile Payment. If you use Mobile Ordering,
          you must provide a valid form of accepted payment before submitting
          your order.

          If you choose to set up Mobile Payment, you must provide credit card
          information which will be remembered for future purchases. You may

          payment methods you have previously saved. If you turn on this feature
          in the app, you can select one of your saved payment methods to
          associate with your Burger King® rewards account (“Royal Perks,” which
          is governed by the{" "}

          For both Mobile Ordering and Mobile Payment, RBI will charge, and you
          authorize us to charge, the payment method you specify at the time you
          place your order. You will be responsible for all applicable taxes and
          fees related to your order. Applicable taxes and fees will be charged
          at the time you are billed. By completing an order, you agree to pay,
          in full, the prices and all applicable taxes and fees in relation to
          your order, either by credit card or other permitted payment method.
          The total amount due may be charged in one (1) or more transactions
          (as determined by RBI in its sole and absolute discretion) (i.e., such
          that the sum of the amounts due to us pursuant to these transactions
          will equal the total amount due to us). We will only charge you the
          invoiced amount, but your financial institution may charge you a
          service charge or other bank fees.

          Pricing and other terms and conditions relating to a purchase may be
          changed, in whole or in part, by RBI at any time without notice
          (unless required by applicable law). Prices for Mobile Ordering may
          differ from those for purchases made through other channels (e.g.,
          in-restaurant or through third parties). We reserve the right to
          change the prices offered through the Mobile Services at any time. We
          reserve the right to change the permitted methods of payment,
          including without limitation, the credit cards and/or other types of
          payment options we are able to accept, at any time.

        <div className="py-3">
          Charges paid for completed orders may not be cancelled, returned, or
          refunded. You may be entitled to a refund, at the sole discretion of
          RBI or its agents, based on the individual circumstances underlying
          each request. However, for the avoidance of doubt, RBI has no
          obligation to provide refunds or credits, but may grant them, in our
          sole discretion. RBI takes fraudulent behavior seriously and has
          filters in place to monitor your orders and, where applicable, at
          RBI’s sole discretion, refund requests. All disputes and refund
          requests are determined on a case-by-case basis in RBI’s sole and
          absolute discretion. Submission of false, misleading, or otherwise
          unjustified refund requests will result in the termination or
          suspension of your ability to use the Mobile Services, as set forth in
          Section 3 below.

          any order if we find evidence of fraud, tampering, and/or any other
          violation of the Terms. We may, in our sole and absolute discretion,

          placed by or under the same account, or using the same payment method,
          credit card, and/or billing information. If we are unable to or choose
