        You have the right to opt out of the sale of your Personal Information
        to third parties, or the sharing of your Personal Information with third
        parties for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. To opt out of
        the usage of the “selling” and “sharing” of information linked to your
        browser identifier, please click on the Do Not Sell or Share My Personal
        Information link on our website footer. If you opt out, you may continue
        to see advertising, including ads that may be based on personal
        information processed before you opted out. This opt-out will apply to
        “selling” and “sharing” of information linked to your browser identifier
        only and not linked to any account information. To opt out of the
        “selling” and “sharing” of personal information tied to your account,

        Alternatively, where available, you can use certain preference signals
        to exercise your sale and sharing opt-out right automatically with all
        businesses that you interact with online, including the POPEYES® brand.
        If you enable a browser-based opt-out preference signal that complies
        with the CCPA, such as Global Privacy Control (GPC), upon receipt or
        detection, we will treat the signal as a valid request to opt out of the
        sale or sharing of Personal Information linked to that browser and any
        consumer profile we have associated with that browser. Please note that
        if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to
        enable the signal on each one that you use.
